This is a Next.js resume website project using TypeScript, featuring neumorphic and glassmorphic design elements. The project uses:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Icons for iconography

The design principles focus on:
1. Neumorphism: Soft, minimalistic UI elements with subtle shadows
2. Glassmorphism: Frosted glass effects with transparency
3. Minimalistic and clean layout
4. Clear section segregation
